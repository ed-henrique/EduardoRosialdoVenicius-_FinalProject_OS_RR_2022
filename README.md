# Compressed Network Communication

Application to demonstrate what was learned during Operational Systems classes with Herbert Rocha.

</br>

This application connects client and server using a socket, and a terminal to the server using a pipe. The client can pass commands to execute on the server's terminal, and then the output will be received by the client. It is similar to a chat app.

## Goals

-  Support more than one client during runtime
-  Use zlib to compress output from server (--compress)
- ðŸš§ Support --host
- ðŸš§ Use pipe to pass commands from server
- âœ… Support --log
- âœ… Support --port
- âœ… Pass input from client to server through socket

---

## Problems Encountered

Problems:

1. Using popen() instead of forking;
2. First command from client always comes with some junk;
3. Can only read either first or last line from pipe output;

Possible Solutions:

1. [Read Data From Pipe in C](https://zditect.com/guide/c/pipe-in-c.html);
2. Flush stdin before taking input;
3. Read pipe char by char, passing them to buffer;
