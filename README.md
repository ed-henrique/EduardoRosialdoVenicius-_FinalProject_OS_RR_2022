# Compressed Network Communication

Application to demonstrate what was learned during Operational Systems classes with [Herbert Rocha](https://github.com/hbgit).

</br>

This application connects client and server using a socket, and a terminal to the server using a pipe. The client can pass commands to execute on the server's terminal, and then the output will be received by the client. It is similar to a chat app.

## Goals

- Use multi buffer system for better memory allocation
- ðŸš§ Support more than one client during runtime
- ðŸš§ Use zlib to compress output from server (--compress)
- ðŸš§ Use fork, pipe and execl to pass commands from server
- âœ… Support --log
- âœ… Support --host
- âœ… Support --port
- âœ… Pass input from client to server through socket

## Problems Encountered

### Problems:

1. **Using popen() instead of forking;**

Possible Solutions:

1. [Read Data From Pipe in C](https://zditect.com/guide/c/pipe-in-c.html);

### Solved Problems:

1. **First command from client always comes with some junk;**
    - Solution = We don't know exactly what changed, but it suddenly works. Even though fflush(stdin) is there, it always was there in the first place, so its weird that now it simply works.

2. **Can only read either first or last line from pipe output;**
    - The solution was to change a line to line approach using fgets() to a read the file as a whole approach using fread().
